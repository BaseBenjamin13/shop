Bugs:
    creating review logs user out, might be because of forced refresh:
        Solution: maybe replace window.reload with navigate.
        but refresh still will log user out, figure out how to keep user logged in.
    fixed:
        to keep user logged in at the end of each crud action i get the data again.
    More permanent fix:
        Use session storage, or local storage.
        Used local storage.


IDEAS: 
    Color wheel to choose there own profile color.
        <input type="color" id="colorTheme" value={registerForm.colorTheme}></input>
        also: type="date" to store birthdate, or "file" for profile img.
